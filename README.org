Blazingly fast web frontend for git written in rust :crab:.

** TODO Features
- [ ]

** What is this project?
I hope to make an alternative to ~cgit~, where you will be able to install
rgit on a server where you are running your git server, and ~rgit~ will create
a simple website to showcase your repositories.

Like ~rgit~ https://github.com/w4/rgit
